# C++ Url Fuzzer üíª
![Swagger Validator](https://img.shields.io/swagger/valid/3.0?specUrl=https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2FOAI%2FOpenAPI-Specification%2Fmaster%2Fexamples%2Fv2.0%2Fjson%2Fpetstore-expanded.json) ![GitHub last commit](https://img.shields.io/github/last-commit/mayhapsDev/urlfuzzer) 
## ‚ú® Overview ‚ú®
- Uses a wordlist to check for url directories
- Fast and eficient  

This is only a basic url fuzzer and wouldn't be practical to use.  
I made it a long time ago as practice so the syntax is probably awful. 



## Prerequisites
